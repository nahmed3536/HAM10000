# HAM10000 Dataset

The dataset is available to download on [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T). More information about what's available and the file structure is available there.

The data isn't provided on this repo because it's extremely large. 

In the future, there will be additional scripts / codes for data loading and processing.
